# Predicting-Newborn-Babies-Birthweight
Predicting the birthweight of newborn babies on the basis of babies birth related features

Investigation of a dataset: Cleaning, exploration and modeling:

Part 1:
Perform cleaning of the dataset, correcting variable types or orders of levels as
needed, and handling missing information appropriately. Perform EDA,
investigating the story the data tells. In particular, investigate which features
relate to birthweight of babies.
Be sure to include summary statistics, correlations, statistical tests, and
visualizations of distributions of all variables. Also include bivariate or trivariate
relationships between important variables, particularly as related to birth weight.
When performing EDA and statistical tests, be sure to follow Motulsky's advice
on visualizing as well as calculating descriptive and inferential and statistics.
Look beyond statistical significance to assess scientific significance (effect size
matters). State accurately what you infer from p-value or confidence level, from
power calculations and statistical tests that you perform.

Part 2:
Fit linear and logistic regression models to this daataset. Evaluate each model
and use best practices to refine your linear and logistic regression models to
arrive at a final interpretable model for each (linear and logistic). For each of
your two final models, select one important categorical variable and one
important numeric variable, stating what the fitted coefficient reveals about the
impact of that predictor variable on the response variable in that model.
For your linear models, fit birth weight as a function of predictor variables.
Evaluate your models according to best practices, and discuss your final
interpretable model, including how you arrived at it. State what you think your
final model reveals about factors that relate to birth weight, and what evidence
you have for your claims.
For the logistic model, fit the dichotomous low birth weight variable as a
function of predictor variables. As with the regression model, evaluate your
models according to best practices, and discuss your final model, including how
you arrived at it. State what you think your final model reveals about factors that
relate to low birth weight, and what evidence you have for your claims.

Dataset variables (1000 births):
dad_age: age of father of baby (years)
mom_age: age of mother of baby (years)
mom_age_level: age level of mother of baby (teens, early 20s, late 20s, early 30s, 35+)
maturity: classify mother as of advanced maternal age or not (advanced / younger)
len_preg: length of pregnancy (weeks)
premie: classify baby as either premature or full-term (premie / full term)
num_visits: number of visits to hospital during pregnancy
mom_wt_gain: mother's weight gain during pregnancy (pounds)
bwt: birth weight of baby (pounds)
low_bwt: classify baby as either low birthweight or not (low / not low)
sex: sex of baby (female / male)
smoke: smoking status of mother (smoker / nonsmoker)
marital: marital status of mother at time of birth (married / not married
mom_white: classify mother as either white or not (white / nonwhite)
